		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Our Codebase</h2>
		
		<p>Hello, and welcome to The Iron Bears (Team 854) FIRST Robotics Robot Codebase for the 2018 FIRST Robotics Competition!
		The files contained in the "documentation and references" folder were created in order to help our programmers understand
		and develop for this codebase. Because our 2018 programming team looks to be especially strong, our code for this year is
		likely to stand out from previous years. I, as well as my peers and teachers, have seen a great amount of talent and
		dedication in this year's software team. We're trying to make our robot code very modular, reusable and reliable while also
		adding in as many advanced features as possible. I hope that you may make use of our code! - Robert C.</p>

		<h2 id="future">Message for the Future</h2>
		<p>If you're reading this and are from the future, then you might find this code to be handy. In fact, I hope that future
		software divisions of Team 854 put this codebase to good use. I might even recommend using our codebase as a starting point
		for your own, as we have developed a great framework as well as a lot of useful functions for any FRC robot, no matter what the
		game is. Maybe I should give Mr. Gunby a golden memory stick with this codebase on it and have him force every next software
		division of our team to study 2018's codebase religously!</p>

		<h2 id="java">Why Use Java?</h2>
		<p>Don't get me wrong, Java is great.<br/><br/>
		
		However, during the 2017 season, Waseef and I wanted to use C++ for the 2018 competition. We had enough knowledge of the language
		in order to be able to use it. After speaking about our potential plan, some mentors had told us that WPILib (necessary for FRC
		Robots) does not work well with C++. Our only other options would be LabView (umm, no thanks) and Java (which we had also used
		a lot).<br/><br/>
		
		For the 2018 season, a lot of great programmers had joined us. Some of them knew C++, but the majority of them have had some
		sorts of Java experience. Considering that our school's Computer Science program teaches Java, it was the way to go.<br/><br/>
		
		I miss pointers, though.</p>

		<h3>Style Guides</h3>
		<p>I added this folder so that we might eventually find/develop a single style guide.</p>
